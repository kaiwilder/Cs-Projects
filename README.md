# C#-Projects

Main Projects created with C sharp

## Projects

* Newsletter
* Car Insurance
* Twenty One Game

### Newsletter

A simple mvc web app that uses Entity Framework 6. Allows users to submit their information for access to a newsletter. There is an admin page that lists all people currently signed up. Created for practice with EF6, no newsletter actually exists.

### Car Insurance

This project is an MVC web app that mimics a car insurance website. It takes in user input and outputs a quote based on business logic. There is also an admin page that allows employees to view all the quotes that have been issued. Uses EF6 for data access.

### Twenty One Game

A game of Blackjack for potential casino use. Created for practice with C# and OOP

##

While these are the biggest projects, there are many more inside the Cs-projects repository, many outlining certan syntax or methods, like lambda expressions and expression handling. I have a couple more projects working with entity framework, with code first database creation, and several more working with MVC apps.
